## The Why

Jumping into <a href="https://dev.to/agathacco">Agathe Cocco's</a> <a href="https://dev.to/agathacco/how-to-create-pure-css-illustrations-and-animate-them---part-2-1ao4">CSS tutorial</a>, I found myself designing assets with pure CSS/Sass/SCSS (going to be honest, 
like when i first learned it didnt really keep up with the Sass). Great set of tutorials, that work your way up out of 3 progessive lessons.

The tutorial accomplishes a simplier(albeit better looking) but I wanted to make it more mine and try more than the tutorial and here we are.

## The State

Currently as it stands... it's "functional", but honeslty not proud of it too much...
- Refractoring seriously needs to be accomplished
- More advance than just Keyframes is a goal
- More refined then what I've accomplished so far to the point of art maybe
